## Chapter 9

International finance institutions: 
* IMF
* World Bank

Both of them set up by the allies and US in 1944

1944: Influential countries came together to create an efficient economic
order. 

Concerns was about what would happen afterwards.

Bretton Woods Agreement.

Large amount of countries that were not colonized. 

Knew that after the war many countries would be decolonized.

Ex: India asking for independence from England.

Bretton Woods Conference:
* How to make the system beneficial to the allies
* IMF and World Bank created
* Made to create new economic order (US wanted to be an economic hegemon)

Perceptions of hegemony: Americans having major influence would allow them 
to have the dollar be the basis of currency

US wanted some system of stability in world trade. Did not want a fair system, but one
that allowed them to exploit other countries.

IMF was made to 
* Oversee the new economic order. 
* Wanted to address potential disruptions that took place during WWII
* Addressing countries with issues of balance of payment difficulties

There would be a process of decolonization. 

Countries decolonizing faced an issue of social and 
political development and issues of payment.

Developing countries needed some way to sustain themselves without help
of colonizing countries.

The IMF and World Bank provided this solution.

Asian countries seeked help from the socialist neighbour.

World Bank(IBRD): bank to redevelop the world for infrastructure and 
development

World Bank was the lender of last resort. Lent out money to other countries 
at low interest rates. US and other rich allies invested money into the 
bank.

Marshall plan was implemented by Allies.

IBRD was an intermediary from the banks and the developing countries

IBRD has a voting distribution based on the power of the countries. 

US could veto, while other countries did not. 

Presidency of the World Bank is usually an American

President of IMF is usually a European

World Bank and IMF have Structural Adjustment Policies (SAPs), 
a set of policies you must adhere by in order to have money from these 
banks. If you do not agree, you will not obtain the money.

SAPs were generic and did not factor in differences in the developing 
countries. 

Standard procedures:
* Undertake austerity measures (spending on expensive issues, political capacity, infrastructure should not be undertaken)
* No subsidies on staple entities (gas, food) [goal was to let the market take control]
* Deregulate the marketplaces (privatization of healthcare, other industries)

What could go wrong with this?
* Could harm lower classes and cause unrest
* Seems to only benefit Western nations

Many countries got loans from the IBRD and the SAPs did not eradicate 
poverty and created more dependency on outside entities. Multinational 
companies benefited from this.

SAPs were continued to be used in the hopes that it would work eventually.

Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea did not borrow money from the 
IMF or World Bank and were successful. 

After researching how these countries obtained their success, 

African countries went with the SAPs and could not pay back.

Mexico accepted SAPs and could not make payment on interest rates and 
had to devalue their currency. 

Issue with SAPs:
* They might work in developed countries, but these policies were not intended in being used in Southern countries

IBRD blamed the failure of SAPs on the lack of good governance.

Lack of good governance came from the colonial governance
* Manipulation of groups to cause conflict between them
* Giving certain groups specific rights 

Colonial owners 

Corruption adds costs to running the economy. 

Countries with lower corruption index are more successful.

Good governance:
* Not be corrupt
* Accountability
* Rule of law

In Canadian constitution, the rule of law is applied everywhere.

Good governance is criticized because 
* Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea did not have good governance but were successful.
* They had strong governments

After 2008, IBRD said they would not provide aid to Brazil

Argentina paid back debt to IMF and cut of relation.

Switch:

Because China changed the economic system in 1993, it became richer. 
Cost of infrastructure went down, had double digit growth rate every year.

China wants to become a world power. Solution? make other countries 
endebtted to you.

China has secured a reputation as a lender.

IMF and IBRD did not like this. They saw their influence was being reduced.

Turned to climate change. Researched about how to improve mitigation 
efforts

Conclusion questions:

Developed world has safety net. 

East Asian crisis: many countries in East Asia ended up devaluing currency

from manipulation of Western


## Chapter 10

Woodrow Wilson made a speech called 14 points of peace. Notion of self-determination
came up.

Important: the speech created the League of Nations, a place where 
countries could discuss issues before engaging in war. 

The house of representatives and senate did not ratify the ratification 
of the treaty to create the League of Nations.

The League of Nations did not have collective security. If one nation 
went to war, what would the others do?

Italians went to Ethiopia. 

WWII started afterwards. There needed to be something to maintain peace.

US said that multilateralism should be brought in.

UN was created in San Francisco treaty in 1945. 

US, China, England, and Soviet Union were important components in 
the UN.

UN has grown over time. Decolonialization has occured.

1989, Soviet Union implodes and entire global system changes. The US 
begins to take a lead in everything.

* Ten non-permanent members come from rest of the world. Two year term
* In charge of peacemaking, peacebuilding 
* In Cold War, the veto was used by US or USSR on the other country

1990: Iraq invades Quwait. 
Americans went to security council since Quwait is an Ally and 
said that the army in Iraq must be removed

Americans did not obtain French or Canadian support, and invaded
Iraq without permission. 

Although the invasion was not permitted, US was not punished

FAO established in 1945: provide governments with information on how to

assure a global education for all.

Challanges UNESCO faced: Some businesses and governments saw education as a commodity to be utilized and 
did not like that UNESCO wanted to provide an education to all regardless of income. The World 
Bank also had great influence over the education policies in low income countries.


UNEP: looks at environmental conditions and tries to resolve environmental
issues.

UNHCR:

OCHA: organizes missions for the UN.

volunteer their military and their military are inserted into warring 
countries.

You have UN, and then Regionalization

Regional entities build relations and groups.

On US side during Cold War, there was NATO. USSR had Warsaw Pact.

NATO condition: if one of its members are attacked, all of its members 
must come to its aid. 

Ex: 9/11, where all allies of US invaded Afghanistan with US

European Union: started off as a trifecta (France, Germany, find out other)

EU did not want a WWIII, thought that building a regional organization 
could improve relations between the countries in Europe.
