## Chapter 12

Civil society is something we have, but we do not know how we obtained it. 

Civic values and traditions: manners, arriving to time on class, being polite, airing your 
grievances, etc.


Interacting with family, education system, and other interactions have ingrained civic 
values. 

Civic values in other countries may differ.

Sidney Verberg and Gabriel Almond: both wanted to figure out why civic values are different 
across the world. 

They figured that it is due to cultural values(religion, music you listen to, etc).  

Ex: singing national anthem every day embeds certain cultural value.

Importance: we have civic values in democratic society. 

Russian citizens do not protest openly about Putin since Russia has a history of 
czars and rulers restricting their freedoms. There is not a history of democratization.

In Vancouver, protests are more common. 

Democratization makes citizens more likely to participate in the system. 

One true measure of participation: electoral turnout. 

Discourse on reflection of civil values:

Liberal: you foster democratic governance by emphasizing the role of the people in 
electing people. If you do not question governance, then it makes the government less 
reliant on the people. 
You want to have civil participation.  

Sociological tradition: civil society as a counter-hegemonic bloc of social forces

Development tradition: It is an agency for empowering and participatory development.

Makes people part of the system and have them decide on their officials.

We form these civic societies voluntarily. By being in a civil society, it brings everyone together 
in a shared identity. 

Your political and social culture identifies how you act in front of others (ex: defending a political 
party in your country)

The civic values you have are learned from your education, your family, and other settings.

Topic has been extensively researched.

The state is supposed to provide these civil agencies to you.
Problem in global North: we accept these values easily.
Problem in Global South: Find it hard to accept values because of capitalism. If you see private
sector attempting to profit off of your labour(corrupt companies, see others trying to exploit you),
you will not appreciate it.

In Global South, there is no safety net.

In Singapore, people do not bother picking a party since the ruling party always wins. 

Emergence of civil society:
* Globalization (make world more connected. When we spread globalization (spread Western ideals and enterprises), the values that are spread are questioned)
* Democratization (belief that democratic values exist in system) (ask professor )
* Privatization (private system in a society has its place) (Canada: should healthcare be private or public?)
* Decentralization (governments decentralize certain powers to sub governments. ex: federal government giving some power to provincial governments)
* Economic liberalization (capitalism)
* Inclusionary state activism (being active and having Civil values)
* Deregulation (Government lets certain services be handled by private companies. Ex: railway service or healthcare is handled by private companies) 

Looking over development of civil society over the years, 

Democracy in Global North would create organizations for yourself

Civil society organizations are interpreted as NGOs.

Ex: MADD, Human Watch

An organization that is not created by the government

NGOs are false saviors of democracy: 
NGOS are trojan horses: use NGOs to infiltrate societies 

Reality: 
Poor are getting poorer (in some countries)

World Bank says that the poor people should group together and ask for benefits.

People participate when their basic needs are not taken care off. If those are not 
taken care off, people will mobilize. 
Ex: people's revolution in phillipines, Arab Springs, 

Response of poor peopple has been to organize in social movements.

Why India's peasents did not group together: (clarify)
Enough peasents did not join a social group

Poor people get negatively affected by globalization through more exploitation.

When you are upper/middle/lower middle class, you have certain rights and have time 
to protest. 
Ex: employees do not have this guarantee since on a strike the employees are not getting 
paid. 

In Global South, people do not have the luxery to organize, since they depend much more 
on their employeers for food, water, living, etc.

Anti globalization movement: 
* Poor people are getting poorer
* Against neo-liberalistic form of globalization
* Ex: Seattle 1994
* Striving for more ethical form of globalization
* Not very prominent today

Since 1980s, new development strategy has emerged.

You want people to be active, but not too active to go against global values.

Social capital: 
* The fact that someone can organize protests and convince people to do what they want
* Ex: civil rights movement
* Some government would be afraid of social capital
* Ex: Ghandi, 
* Peasents rising up in Brazil
* Protests in Iran

Poorest person's asset is social capital

Rarely see social capital in developed societies since there are safety valves to make 
sure this pressure does not build up. Ex: can push politicians

If poor protest, then they lack the money they need to survive.

How do you control social capital, bring it about, and focus it to control meaningful change?

Policy makers argue that social capital is good, but there must be initiative to have change 
in societies. 

IGOS: UN, IMF, WB

NGOS: Docters Without Borders, Red Cross, Red Crescent

Arguements:
* NGOs create social capital
* NGOs work in private sector

Do NGOs serve the poor in order to appeal to the capitalists in that society, or are they 
serving another form of development?
Primary goal: serve civil societies.
Needed for engagement in society.

CSO: state helps out in targeting specific NGOs to be responsible. 
Ex: Brazil's MST

MNC: multinational corporations
Primary goal: make money

Conclusion: 
We have created inequalities through Neoliberal globalization

In order to help out Global South, we must introduce Civic values to the Global South.

If people do not have these civic values (mobilization, expectation to certain rights), then 
they will not have it. Ask professor about this

If the state is corrupt, the NGOs may take charge in order to empower poor people.



## Midterm details

Will be given chapters to focus on. 

Focus on the lectures.

Two parts: 
1. Multiple choice section, 20 points, (ex: which of these ) 
2. Essay portion, 40 points,  (answers will be three to four pages long, double-sided)

For the essay portion, you must pick one of three essay topics and write about it. 

Chapters that we should be paying attention to:
1-5
Chapters 7-10

Question: 
How can you empower people in the Global North?
If you empower people economically, then it will develop more

As you incorporate these values, people will see the benefit and begin to accept it more

Expanding on human rights and institutionalize human rights through organizations. Encourage 
the belief that people have human rights. 

People must escape the mindset they have been taught, but people striving to bring Western 
values must ask what rights they have to bring these values.

Have NGOs to foster community involvement 

Critical mass: make the most change to the benefit of most people.
