## Chapter 1
In the past, first, second, and third world were terms that were used to distinguish countries.

Now, we have the global North and South.

Many of the developing countries share a history of colonialization and 
the effects it left behind.

With labels, we can control public policy and legitimizes current practices.

Terms of development and underdevelopment can be traced to Harry Truman in 1949, where 
he stated that countries plagued by socialism and communism could ask the Americans for 
assistance. 

Development is a comparative concept, it is always with reference to something. In this case, we 
are comparing with the developed countries.

Non-aligned movement: invented in 1950s, 1960s

The term Third World was used as an old label, and carried negative connotations. Implicated that
transitions to not being a Third World country was impossible.

New labels: NIC, Global South.

The qualifications to be known as a NIC is 
1. Manufacturing contribute 30% of GDP
2. Manufactured goods are 50% of exports
3. More people are employed in industry than
   agriculture
4. Per capita income of US$2,000 (as of 1991)

World Bank classification:
* low-income countries
* lower-middle income countries 
* upper-middle income countries
* high-income country
* OECD income country

Developing economies are those in the low-income and lower-middle
income countries

Higher developing countries are those not in the first two incomes

Fourth World: poorest of the poor, failed states,

How do you measure development?

Different conceptions of poverty, levels of industrializations, 
notions of a good life, and more make measuring development hard

When India, Pakistan, and Indonesia became independent, 
scholars in the Global North wrote about how the Global South
can imitate the Global North.

Rostow's stages of economic growth: Global South should follow the 
policies that the Global North used

World Bank

Growth in GDP is caused by 
* Higher agricultural output
* Increase in utilization of natural resources
* More industrialization

GDP is the belief that every person should have a certain amount
of product in the economy. 

Argument was that an increase of GDP would help out the poorer 
people since the assumption was that everyone was receiving the 
money equally.

This did not work in practice since it did account for the 
inequality of income distribution in the country.

Distribution of income: how much the rich have in comparison to 
how much the poor have out of the total income of a society

Gini coefficient: measures the level of inequality in the society.

We are also concerned with inequality.

Why does income inequality occur?
* Impact of colonial rule
* Neo-colonial economic relations
* Late industrialization of developing countries
* Lack of social safety nets
* Regressive taxation

Inequality leads to poverty. 

Definitions of poverty by World Bank:
* Absolute poverty: 1.25 USD a day
* Moderate poverty: 2 USD a day

Poverty does not only have financial impacts, it can 
impact your education, social environment, and psychological 
state.

Dudley Sears: What are conditions for realization of human 
potential? poverty harms that

Goulet: Development as life substanace

Sen: Poverty is un-freedom, development is freedom.

How do we measure development? GDP, PPP?

UN created HDI, a measure of healthcare, education, and standard
of living. A more holistic way of measuring development

UNDP's Human Development Report says measuring by GDP is not 
enough, and that we need development goals.

Multidimensional approaches are twinned with a human rights-based
approach

UN in 2006 published report saying that human rights and development
are important landmark occasion.

Moral obligation to reduce poverty is not shared by countries, and 
begs the question of what duty citizens have in temrs of reducing 
poverty?

In developed countries, welfare policies are common.

Can you expect developed worlds to have welfare policies?

Ways to think about global redistributive justice:
Define these terms later

Cosmopolitanism: for
Communitarianism: against
Libertanarianism: against

Cosmopolitan: Justice is owed to all people regardless of money 
and where you are located

Communitarianism: takes a nationalist approach, specific 
rights and duties are reserved for the nation

Libertarianism: individual rights to private property is 
vital and opposes global redistribution.

Millennium Development Goals: not successful, but laid down
format for countries to decrease poverty

Promise of 0.7% of GNP to development assistance.

Ethical behavior: expected of researchers and practitionards 
or development



## Chapter 2
Americas were discovered in 16th century by European Imperialism 
Some may argue it was for financial gain, political motives,
nationalist motives

Imperialism: a political system in which colonies are ruled from a 
central seat of power for financial gain

Neo-colonialism: economies of former independent countries remain
subordinate to the control of others

Colonization: process of settling and occupying territory with
some peoples ruling over others.


Europeans had control of the world for much time. 
Colonized many parts of the world.
African mass slave trade, where slaves from Africa would 
be sold in exchange for tobacco and rum.
Europeans dominated Africa until 1914.

Common themes of colonial experiences:
Social Darwanist ideas: some people would be better off 
being exposed to western ideas

Indigenous peoples were overwhelmed with advanced technology.
Civilizing misison of Europeans.

Goal: transform Indigenous economies into ones modelling European 
countries. Ended up being export oriented economies, selling fruit,
diamonds, gems, cotton, tea, coffee, etc. The colonized countries
became dependent on the European countries

Africa's self determination happened after WWII. 

## Chapter 3
What was left behind after colonialism was a poor political 
system and strife between the various groups

Why is development to have failed?
Development failed because the gap between rich and poor has
not changed
Millennium goals did not work out
Globalization has created an us and them perspective

Capitalism brought to development workers right and labour.
Brought wealth to countries.

Why the Developed World payed attention to developing world:
They were direct reminders of the imperialist acts they committed.

Development was product of confrontation between captalism and 
communism.

Soviet Union was beacon of communism

Bretton Woods Agreement created
* IMF
* World Bank

Third World economies had high demand of their primary 
products from First World.

Both First and Third World countries wanted to maintain these 
relationships

### Economic theories of development
Keynesian economics: growth is increased through foreign capital 
and macroeconomic policies

Lewis: as labour becomes scarce, wages becomes higher

Rostow: we go from a traditional country to one of mass consumption
in different stages. Looked at stage theory. Many holes in theory.

Modernization theory: argument of whether you have democracy and 
then a viable economy, or vice versa

Dependency theory: originated in Latin America in 1960s
Argues that there are core and periphery countries. Periphery
countries supply raw materials to core countries. Periphery
countries are dependent on core countries, and makes it impossible
for periphery countries to catch up. Argues for two way flow from 
periphery countries to core countries 


There are different types of dependency. 

Wallerstein: talked about world capitalist system

Marxism: critique of dependency theory. Argues for core and periphery country 
based on dependency aspects of things
Focuses on exploitation of weaker states. There is only a one 
way trend from periphery countries to core countries.

Neoliberalism: contested development strategies and goals. 
Focused on individualism and capitalism. The economic pie would 
grow.

People thought Neoliberalism would work for developing countries.
Read through the slides.

Development theory scholarship: different ways of development 
exist. 

You see countries with Neoliberalist policies, like the US, is 
not doing that well considering the recession.

China has shown growth even during the pandemic. Comparatively
