## What is the difference between the MDGS and the SDGS
SDGs differ from the MDGs as they have goals for sustainable consumption and production. 
They also want to promote inclusive economic growth.

### Who is Rostov

Rostov was an economist who believed that traditional societies had to pass through 
five stages before becoming a high mass consumption society.

First stage: Traditional
Second state: pre-conditions for take-off
Third: Take-off
Fourth: drive to maturity
Fifth: modern


Characteristics of each stage:
* Traditional: societies had pre-newtonian understanding of society.
* pre-conditions for take-off: trade expansion, increase in development, and creation of a nation state
*  Take-off: 10% of GDP is invested in economy and agricultural and industrial production exceeds rate of population growth
* drive to maturity: Production of a diverse range of products, including technologically advanced ones. Continual growth, greater integration into the world economy
* modern: consumption expanded beyond basic needs and average incomes are high. 

### Who is Karl Marx

Critiqued Capitalism on three issues:
* Workers were paid pittances in proportion to the value of what they produced. 
* There was no stability in the market and sometimes the chaos caused by the crises undid the change Capitalism brought


### David Ricardo
Economist who had the theory of comparative advantage:

* Each country has an advantage when compared to the other countries in terms of some product or resource it produces/extracts. Countries will benefit from specializing in a certain resource and trading with other countries for items which they do not have.

### Amartya Sen

Sees wealth as a way to have freedom in the life you live.

Poverty limits that freedom drastically. 

Multiple types of unfreedoms: poverty, racism, sexism, lack of access to food, lack of access to health 
services.

By improving the level of access to government services, such as education, healthcare, participation 
in the political system, it can bolster the freedoms people have by giving them more opportunities.
Ex: participating in the political system lets you make decisions that impact your access 
to resources, and that could allow you to gain more freedoms as a result. 

### Washington consensus
recommended the liberalization of capital flows and trade (through free trade agreements), 
the privatization of the public sector, and the abolition of market-restricting regulations.
It became a central component of structural adjustment programs imposed by the Bank and the 
IMF on countries that required loans.

### Nation and Nation-state

A state is a territory where the group that governs has widespread control over the territory and 
any means of force within. They are also supported by the citizens of that territory to such
usage of that force and control. The legitimacy of the state's control is accepted by other 
states and the citizens allow the governing body to make public decisions.

A nation-state is a state where the population shares historical, cultural, or ethical 
commonalities.

### What was the Bandung conference and what did it establish?

The Bandung conference was a conference held in 1955 where countries outside of the 
US and Soviet Union stated their demands to end colonialism. They also condemned the 
integration of their countries into the world economic system.

This conference established the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), which  seeks to uphold 
the right of independent judgement, the struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism, 
and the use of moderation in relations with all big powers.

### What is The World Bank
Created at the Bretton Woods Conference.

The World Bank was established after WWII to grant loans to European countries affected by the 
war. That objective changed quickly to giving loans at low rates to developing countries,   
focusing mainly on projects involving infrastructure.

The World Bank offered conditional loans, needing countries to agree to an SAP in order 
to access the money.

#### Membership in the World Bank
Voting power in the World Bank is dependent on the size of the economy of the country.      

#### What is an SAP
An SAP is a set of policies which set the conditions for obtaining money from the World Bank.
These policies include austerity measures, deregulation, and the removal of domestic subsidies.

SAPs forced countries to suspend investment and consumption and to direct their efforts 
towards increasing exportation of primary materials.

The SAPs that the World Bank offered did not work in Mexico and in African countries.
The World Bank explained this as originating from a lack of good governance.

SAPs may have worked in Northern countries, but they were not planned to be used in developing
countries. 

### What is the IMF
Created at the Bretton Woods Conference.

The IMF was made after WWII to oversee the new economic order, and to 
assist countries with balance of payments.

IMF was a way for developing countries to receive assistance without depending on the 
developed countries.

Countries could take out money within the IMF to avoid devaluing their currency.


### Comparative advantage
It is the idea that each country has a product that they have an advantage towards 
producing/procuring, and that each country should focus their efforts on producing 
what they specialize in.
