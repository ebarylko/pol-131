that the profits earned from the produced products is not divided equally among everyone.

Issues with defining and measuring development:

### Using GDP as a way to measure development

### measuring development using HDI

HDI is a measure looking at the lifetime of a citizen, the level of education received by all 
citizens, and the GNP per capita.

* Believed that all citizens, regardless of country of origin, income level, gender, race,
etc, deserved justice.
