Answers: 
1. 
The meaning of development is contested as the rubric for determining whether a 
country was developed was based on Western ideals, not taking into consideration 
that there are other forms of development. Furthermore, the analysis of whether a
country is developed may use few attributes of the country, such as the gross national income.
This can lead to an erroneous conclusion since a high gross national income
does not inform us of the extent of poverty,
the education individuals receive, or if the healthcare system is adequate, to list some 
examples. 

Since the analysis of whether a country is developed may not be multifaceted, it calls into
question how we are measuring development and whether the aspects being examined
give us enough information about the country.
