### Review
How did we get to the divisions of the global north
and south through imperialism and colonialism

### Chapter 4
#### Important: post-development, state, and aid
How to write a first year paper in political science

Where did post development or anti-development come from?
* Without thinking about connotation of development, we can think of it as economic development
* We can use more detailed measures of development such as the HDI
* The ideals used in development is western and forces countries in the global to adhere to western ideals.
* If countries can develop in non-western ways, why are the development approaches focusing on western ideals?

Many writers wrote about post development, saying
that
Start at being economically developed before developing politically.
Southern countries must embrace neoliberalism to do so.

Political development: if the politicians are responsive to the needs of the people.
Economic development: having the economic capacity to fulfill needs (food, housing)
Political capacity (western concept): ask professor about this

India, China, Japan were developed before they

Writers say to reject development and do something new. 
Criticize process of development. 


Ex: America invaded Afghanistan and tried to educate
the students in the American way. Some citizens refused 
saying that there are other forms of education (Islamic education)
.


* Some argue that development is western in nature.
* Development is coercive in nature.

Two camps at the end of WWII:
* Communism with the Soviet Union
* Capitalism with America

Both camps wanted to avoid the other persuading
more underdeveloped countries to their cause

Truman believed that the underdeveloped countries 
had to be taken away from the Soviet Union.

Promised that the underdeveloped countries would be developed if
they followed western principles.

Marshall plan: a plan to help countries after 
WWII to help them continue to be capitalist

At the same time, the Cold War was going on.


Notion of development was to create a good life,
eradicate  poverty, economic growth. 

The development we have seen has not achieved this.

How de we measure a good life?

Different ways:
* Monetary expenses
* The number of infrastructures in place to help citizens

#### Has development been evenly distributed in societies?

Norms: ideas considered as normal

In various countries the norms are different.

The end of (western) development:
* Productivity does not lead to economic growth. It just increases what capitalists gain.
* The idea of a paradise for everyone has not been realized
* The gap between rich and poor countries has increased
* Development has only lead to westernize the word, erasing the local culture in other countries

Development models:
* Liberalization
* Industrialization

In other parts of the world, people have different
ways of living and needs.

It makes no sense to tell people that they need to imitate
western models.

Political development: make the government
more receptive to the people

ask professor about this
Economic development: achieved through Neoliberalism

Reclaiming knowledge:
* Science has a western lens 

### Chapter 5


### Chapter 6


How did the west become so prominent in the
world?

The answer is globalization.

Through globalization, the world becomes smaller
as everyone becomes connected

Globalization has entwined public and private space.

Globalization should create an even world, and each country
should have an even economic development. 

The world is interconnected, but some parts of the world
are still separated.

Cold War:
* period of tension with the Soviet Union lasting 18 years


Cardoso: 
* Development needs to be integrated into the world system, accepting policies set by World Bank, IMF, G8
* Must adopt capitalism
* Cold War created new economic system
* Developing country must integrate with globalization and not go against it

Important: East Asian Miracle
South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore,  

Did not use Western methods of development. They
used the values and methods of their own cultures.

Globalization has created gap between rich
and the wealthy. 

Can argue that globalization makes 
If globalization is supposed to reduce the gap,
why does the gap between countries exist?

World trade has prompted developing countries to open up their market.

Who is benifitting from this?
China is benefitting,
poorer countries do not benefit.

Globalization has not eradicated poverty?

Can it eradicate poverty?

No, since capitalism is a system meant to exploit others,
assuring that you will not have true equality

Africa only accounts for less than 1% of the worlds gdp.
External debt has increased.

Poverty levels in Africa are not improving.

Cannot blame poverty in countries on Capitalism and Liberalism. Another 
thing to notice is corruption. 

Who benefits from globalization?

The rich benefit from this as they become richer.

Case: China

China's success from post-1948 
argue that China would be less powerful if it
continued with Communism. Dave xioping? (review last name)
changed economic system in 1970


Expansion of Western capitalism has increased
due to 

Decisions are made by G8, not by poor countries

The development of developing countries is controlled
by developed countries

Globalization: Will it help the developing countries or leave them in the same state

Some believe globalization is another form of imperialism.

Rich countries still dominate.

Anti-globalization movement: 

Mexico 1994: protest by Zapatistas

Seattle 1991: international NGOs and social movements
protested WTO

Housing crisis in 2008 affected everyone. Poorer countries suffered 
more from this than the rich countries.

Arab Spring in 2011:
* Started in Tunisia
* Triggered by self-immolation unemployed student
* Unemployment rate in that point was 34%

Arab Spring created protests in other parts of the words.
* Protest on wall street

Looking ahead:
* Debate to being cultural development to global north


In Africa, the medicine for stabilizing your condition when having
AIDS was expensive, and protests were held about the price of the medication

Why medicine was expensive: 
* In global north it could be afforded
* In global south it could not be afforded (because of capitalism)
* Some would argue that research is expensive and that it justifies the price

## Chapter seven

State: entity with monopoly over the means of force within a territory it controlled.

Idea of a state came from the 30 Year War (1618 - 1648)

They made a treaty since they were achieving nothing. 

The treaty of Westphalia:
* Creates the idea of one nation, one state.
* Created notion of what it means to live in a country

Nation-state: 
* Have governance
* Have sovereignty 
* 

Citizenship is an artificial concept.

There are certain countries that are singular nation states.

Take idea of nation-state and transpose it on the developing worlds.

Ex: applying it on India.

Issue: most of the countries in the developing world are not a single people.

Trying to have create a nation in places where the population is diverse, it can be problematic.


Pakistan: created for the Muslim people
India: made for secular people

Under colonial rule, countries were colonized and were mercantilised so their
economy and state served foreigners.

Important concept: nation-state

Ex: Singapore is an artificial creation, a mesh of Indian and Chinese people the British
brought over

Colonial legacy brought over military and bureacuracy (correct)

Ask professor about this
If you leave behind an alien concept of nation state, you need to what?

Civil War and Revolutionary War caused the Americans to be more nationalist.
For Canadians, there are no such events to bond the citizens together with such ferocity.

State capacity: the ability of the state to handle the chores of society
Many of the countries in the North left to the global south.
Many countries do not have state capacity

Traditional societies are governed by western term of a nation states
e
Autonomy was challenged in some part of the worlds.

Keynesians: state spending must happen in order to be applied to a society

Keynesian policies were applied in many countries.

Push for industrialization continued in form of Import Substitution Industrialization:
* Instead of importing goods from outside world, why not make it yourself?
* Instead of spending your own money, you can make the product and gain revenue
* Ex: Malaysia followed this
  * Malaysia borrowed money from IMF and WB in order to produce cars
  * Nobody brought their cars because the car had no quality attached to it
  * They now owed more money to the IMF and WB


Example of how transferring knowledge from global north to south did not
work.

The four dragons followed Export Led Industrialization and it worked for them.


From notion of nation state, there comes non-market factors which create idea of good governance
* Institution building
  * Idea of evolution was different from the western world
* Through process of colonialization, a power imbalance was left behind and as a result corruption is more visible
  * Ex: Americans in Japan left behind a constitution to transfer territory

For economists, state-coordination should be with private sector

Need participation in society

Essay topics are on canvas

Way to write an essay:
Think of essay as a diagram

introduction -> arg1 -> arg2 -> arg3 -> conclusion
Argumentative essay that needs a thesis statement

Thesis statement: topic and arguments
If you write about the world bank, you need to do some research about it

Do not want a descriptive essay of the world bank, want an argumentative essay

Ex: The world bank is ineffective in creating parity in economics  

This is the topic

The arguments are the following:
* The structural (what words come after)
* The imbalance of power
* structural adjustment policies

At the end, you write your thesis again.

Arguments go in-between introduction and conclusion


Question to answer:
* Why has the global south had a difficult time progressing?
Use notion of development, how it exploits the global south to a 
great extent, colonialism, etc.

* Lack of resources and differences in quality of technology has 

Possible responses:
* After WWII it left a vacuum of many institutions (law, general institutions)
* Global North profits off global South (cheap labour, resources), but this causes the Global South to not care about its citizens (mercantalism)
* Global North has monopoly of power (militarily, economically, politically) and wishes to maintain this order. 
* Industrial revolution happened in Global North first, so they had a headstart. With the building of railroads, they connect to other countries that were not industrialized and were able to profit off of the countries
* Exploited countries have not had the opportunity to develop their own industry. They become dependent on foreign powers.
* The global South relies on the global north, in order to have the economic security from the global north, they will continue to provide resources to global north
* Incentive to draw human capital (educated people) to the global north as the move represents a way for people to develop themselves.
* Modern day capitalism: keep global south poor in order to become richer

Brain drain ex: nurses from the Phillipines move to here for a better salary. This 
harms the phillipine government as they need those nurses, but Canada takes
these nurses.


However, that is changing. You may move to the global south for a better life as things 
are becoming expensive in the global north.

Controlling class leaves behind residue of governance. When they leave,
## Questions

Is there fair and unfair exploitation?

When we reclaim knowledge, are we also reclaiming culture? Is that implied?
